`useLeaflet` is a hook for using with [react-leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-leaflet).

It solves <https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/issues/539>.

For some reasons the author of [react-leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-leaflet) is not gonna support hooks in `react-leaflet@2`.

The discussion is here <https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/571>.

## Usage

```javascript
import { Map } from "react-leaflet"
import { useLeaflet } from "use-leaflet"

const MyLeafletComponent = (props) => {
  const { map } = useLeaflet()
  // ....
}

const App = () => (
  <Map>
    <MyLeafletComponent />
  </Map>
)
```

Keep in mind, that `useLeaflet` hook will work only in components which are used within `Map` component, the same as `withLeaflet` HOC from `react-leaflet`.
